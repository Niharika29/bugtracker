This is a Bug Tracking/Reporting/administering app developed as part of Google Summer of Code for TimVideos organization. 

The user can report bugs and the frontend does automated data collection, which then gets stored in a Pbackend database. 

An Admin can view the bugs and the information collected and perform operations on them.
